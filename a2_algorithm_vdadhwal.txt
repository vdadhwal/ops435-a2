OPS435 – Assignment 2 winter 2020- Algorithm


Process a list of all users logged in (and out) on a UNIX/Linux system from a text file created by the shell command "last -F"




Input 

The user passes arguments in the form of user information and daily , weekly and monthly report.   
An input is taken from the file in the form of date , time , day and month.
All these inputs are stored in variables that will be used later.

Processing

Normalizing the data : If the login and logout data contains the same day and month , it need not be normalized.

If the day variable isn't the same , we compare the date and month. 
a) If the month is not same , we compare the months through a dictionary key:value and subtract the logout month and login month.(not complete yet)
   We then compare the dates 
   (i) For the first login month - count the no of the days left for the month from a (month:day) dictionary 
   (ii) For the logout month - count the no of days preceding the date again by comparing from the (month:day) dictionary
   
   On the basis of the daily , weekly or the monthly report
   (i) Daily report - all the logins with same day ,same date and same month and simply subtract the login and logout times of each login and all of them.
   (ii) Weekly report - all the logins throughout a week where the week shall start from a Monday and obviously last till the Sunday. Thus the logins of a user shall be counted for the week.
   (iii) Monthly report - all the logins of a user in a whole month shall be added to produce the report.
   
 Output:
 Display, as required in the task (formatting, spacing etc.), the output of the processed data
